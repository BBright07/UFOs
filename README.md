# UFOs
Overview of Project:
    This project focused on assessing the sightings of UFOs and helping many, including Dana, to see the possibility of life beyond Earth.
Results: 
    Through this website, clients can filter based on city, state, date, shape, and country. They can get a good sense on where sightings occured and this can promote trips to previous sightings.

Summary: 
    This new design promotes a brief overview of the nature and kind of sightings. However, if a 'sound' component was added, it would be very beneficial in helping all understand what the extraterrestrial being sounded like. Additionally, links to images of what was seen would help better assess the veracity of the sightings.
